	                                    <p>I would encourage not. Designing your site will be based on <strong>modular</strong> preferences instead.</p>
	                                    <p>It's something different I do. Instead of going the conventional way - presenting it wholly, I only present segments of web templates as design library to my client. Also, I <i>grayscale</i> these segments. As a matter of fact, I encourage my client to generate something like an <i>inspiration board</i> - where we simply pin websites we admire the style, or smaller components where the content related to them. This enables my client and I to pay far more attention to the structures, details and the workflow of the site. Indeed, it easily makes us see things clearly and think <i>outside the box</i> instead of a template that encourages dumping all thought process inside a box.</p>
	                                    <p>On another note, this step-by-step approach 'defragments' the design process into extremely manageable parts which in turn avoids the ugly situation where the client becomes dissatisfied upon the project completion. The client must okay each stage until the design becomes a monument. Both parties are best served as we avoid miserable time wastage and hurtful backtracking.</p>
	                                    <p>Nevertheless, a full template-based work has its positives as it is faster, ceteris paribus, and leaves little room for contention. Thus I respect my clients' wishes and will get the job done if it is their preference.</p>

	                                    <p>It is a good idea for your website to be re-evaluated from time to time as search engines do alter their rules and algorithms. No one can guarantee any search results as Google, Bing and other search engines often make adjustments to the results they show.</p>
	                                    <p>There is so much to building a successful online business. Things like understanding what potential customers really want, content marketing, paid ads, sales funnels, conversion optimization, seo and so much more</p>
	                                    <p>One thing is sure though. Improved search ranking comes from well-written and structured code. Adhering to the fundamentals of the leading search engines leads to better placement.</p> <p>Here are some of the efforts I make to code search-engine friendly websites:</p>
	                                    <ul>
	                                        <li>Dynamic on-page meta descriptions.</li>
	                                        <li>Meta descriptions</li>
	                                        <li>Media queries for varying target screen widths and mobiles</li>
	                                        <li>HTML5 for richer semantic markup</li>
	                                        <li>New HTML5 aria- and roles for webpage and web application accessibility</li>
	                                    </ul>

	                                    <p>There is no real web development without some sort of SEO, so the answer is yes &mdash; somehow, but there are a few things to be aware of.
	                                    </p>                                        
	                                    <p>I only do SEO during the website creation which is the minimum requirement for any professional web developer. Even after obeying all of Google's guidelines, you cannot simply expect free traffic. You must earn it. When the website is alive, it becomes your duty to 'grow' your website, generate traffic and convert leads to clients. SEO is a lifetime necessity for a website, and is thus no joking matter! SEO is usually an <em>ongoing</em> solution.
	                                    </p>
	                                    <p>Big businesses are fully aware of this fact. <b>If you know you are not up for it, and have not the knowledge or time to actively grow your site, in my opinion it is best to hire an SEO company or expert, or a digital marketer</b>. Caveat emptor: There are quite a number of "experts" who employ somewhat risky and aggressive techniques that could incur Google's wrath on your site. You may have heard of the term, <dfn>"Black Hat SEO"</dfn>, you really want to beware. To cut to the chase, you will have to make some research on whose SEO service you employ.</p>
	                                    <p>Below I outline a number of tried-and-true Google-adhering SEO techniques that I follow, which mostly pertain to the period of website creation and page structuring:</p>
	                                    <ul>
	                                        <li>Domain name to exactly match your keywords.</li>
	                                        <li>I encourage clients to register '.com' if possible. Or '.org' and '.net' as viable alternatives.</li>
	                                        <li>'.com' version of domain names for country-specific locations.</li>
	                                        <li>Google Analytics installation to already have an idea of what you rank for.</li>
	                                        <li>Keyword phrase target as oppose individual words.</li>
	                                    </ul>
	                                    <p>Other optimisation techniques I incorporate &mdash; homepage or site-wide include:</p>
	                                    <ul>
	                                        <li>Keyword placement in page titles, with the most important keyword phrase close to the beginning of the title.</li>
	                                        <li>Site title made short.</li>
	                                        <li>Overlap keyword phrases in page title to pick up multiple search phrases.</li>
	                                        <li>Meta description (old school &mdash; yes, but makes no sense not having any).</li>
	                                        <li>Meta keywords to contain common comma-delimited misspellings and synonyms</li>
	                                        <li>Reinforcement of page title by having<code>H1</code> tag contain similar keyword phrases.</li>
	                                        <li><code>H2</code> and <code>H3</code> tags for more description.</li>
	                                        <li>Home Page to direct consumer to important parts of the website.</li>
	                                        <li>Primary keyword phrase inclusion to home page from other parts of the site.</li>
	                                        <li>Descriptive alt text for images.</li>
	                                        <li>External stylesheets.</li>
	                                        <li>Unobtrusive JavaScript.</li>
	                                        <li>HTML5 coding.</li>
	                                        <li>Sitemap creation and due submission to Google for site ranking purposes.</li>
	                                    </ul>
	                                    <p>During the course of the project, I also send an SEO-checklist via mail to my client to have food for thought. And this is where it usually ends for me. Search Engine Optimisation vis-a-vis Digital Marketing rest on some other pillars you may already be aware of like: Pay-Per-Click (PPC), Social Media Management (SMM) and Content Marketing - the combination which may offer better lead and conversion and increased visibility on search engines. Content Marketing would entail the correct tone and a writing style, unique brand content generation and a developed habit of fresh content publication. Most importantly, your publications or products must solve whatever user's questions or problems which is why I encourage to simply write for people, not just search engines, and whatever you sell &mdash; service or product, ensure it's quality!</p>
